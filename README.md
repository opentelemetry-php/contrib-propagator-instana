OpenTelemetry Instana Propagator

The OpenTelemetry Propagator for Instana provides HTTP header propagation for systems that are using IBM Observability by Instana.
This propagator translates the Instana trace correlation headers (`X-INSTANA-T/X-INSTANA-S/X-INSTANA-L`) into the OpenTelemetry `SpanContext`, and vice versa.
It does not handle `TraceState`.


## Installation

```sh
composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry-propagation-instana
```

## Usage

```
$propagator = InstanaMultiPropagator::getInstance();
```

Both of the above have extract and inject methods available to extract and inject respectively into the header.

## Propagator Details

There are three headers that the propagator handles: `X-INSTANA-T` (the trace ID), `X-INSTANA-S` (the parent span ID), and `X-INSTANA-L` (the sampling level).

Example header triplet:

* `X-INSTANA-T: 80f198ee56343ba864fe8b2a57d3eff7`,
* `X-INSTANA-S: e457b5a2e4d86bd1`,
* `X-INSTANA-L: 1`.

A short summary for each of the headers is provided below. More details are available at <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=monitoring-traces#tracing-headers>.

### X-INSTANA-T -- trace ID

* A string of either 16 or 32 characters from the alphabet `0-9a-f`, representing either a 64 bit or 128 bit ID.
* This header corresponds to the [OpenTelemetry TraceId](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md#spancontext).
* If the propagator receives an X-INSTANA-T header value that is shorter than 32 characters when _extracting_ headers into the OpenTelemetry span context, it will left-pad the string with the character "0" to length 32.
* No length transformation is applied when _injecting_ the span context into headers.

### X-INSTANA-S -- parent span ID

* Format: A string of 16 characters from the alphabet `0-9a-f`, representing a 64 bit ID.
* This header corresponds to the [OpenTelemetry SpanId](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md#spancontext).

### X-INSTANA-L - sampling level

* The only two valid values are `1` and `0`.
* A level of `1` means that this request is to be sampled, a level of `0` means that the request should not be sampled.
* This header corresponds to the sampling bit of the [OpenTelemetry TraceFlags](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md#spancontext).
